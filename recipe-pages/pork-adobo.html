            The word 'Adobo' is derived from the Spanish word 'Adobar', meaning to marinate through the use of  a liquid mix, or through a rub using powdered ingredients. The Filipino version of Adobo suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. Then cooked with vinegar.

            <h4> How to make it:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Cut the pork belly to your preferred size and crush garlic cloves</li>
                <li> Mix the cut pork belly and the crushed garlic into a container. Add in soy sauce to your preference, add less for a drier adobo. </li>
                <li> Let it marinade for at least one hour. If you have plenty of time, marinate it overnight for stronger flavour to penetrate the pork</li>
                <li> Place your marinated pork in a cooking pot, cook until dark brown but not burnt. Keep the marinade sauce and garlic for later</li>
                <li> Once sufficiently browned, pour in the remaining marinade sauce and garlic into the pot</li>
                <li> Add about 500 ml of water (add less for a drier adobo), peppercorns, and dried bay leaves then bring to a boil. Simmer for about 40 minutes to 1 hour. </li>
                <li> Put in about four tablespoons of vinegar and let it simmer for another 12 to 15 minutes</li>
                <li> Add salt to taste</li>
                <li> Serve hot with rice and enjoy!</li>
