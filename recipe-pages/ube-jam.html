        <p>
            The deep purple coloured yam, Ube, is a popular ingredient in the Philippines. 
            It has a similar texture to sweet potatoes but are sweeter in flavour.
            Ube Jam is commonly used in doughs, pastries and the crushed-ice dessert, Halo-halo.

            <h4> How to make it:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Rinse the ube, then boil them whole in a pot until they are tender in the middle. This will take about 30 to 40 minutes with 1.5 lbs (675 g) of ube </li>
                <li> Once cooked through, let them cool before peeling off the skin then chop them into pieces that will fit in your food processor or blender. </li>
                <li> Add the ube into a food processor or blender, then mix in a cup (8oz/240ml) each of evaporated milk, full-fat coconut milk and sugar, and 14oz/397g of condensed milk </li>
                <li> Once mixed well into a smooth paste, move it into a pot and put on a lid. Heat over medium/low until it simmers. </li>
                <li>
                    Simmer for about 40-45 minutes and stir the mixture continually while cooking to prevent the jam from being burnt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the jam thickens, mix in half a cup (4oz/115g) of butter and a quarter teaspoon of salt then stir until they are incorporated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will know that your ube jam is done when it seemingly stays in place when you drag your spoon down the middle of the pot.
                </li>
                <li> At this point, whether to continue stirring is up to how thick or spreadable you want your jam to be. If you prefer it thinner and easier to spread, stop stirring sooner. Remember that the jam will continue to thicken when chilled in the fridge!</li>
                <li>
                    Once you get the consistency you prefer, carefully transfer them your prefered heat-resistant container and close their lid.
                    Allow them too cool down to room temperature before refrigerating (To prevent thermal shock on the containers).
                </li>
                <li> Enjoy it as a spread on your bread, or as an ingredient in a pastry, or simply by itself!</li>
